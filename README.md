# Autopublisher

Automatically publishes new messages sent into announcement channels by bots and webhooks.

Add the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=896487543732834395&permissions=11264&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

## Troubleshoting
If messages aren't being published properly, make sure of the following:

* The bot has the following permissions in the channel:
	* Read Messages
	* Manage Messages
* The announcement channel has not published more than 10 messages in the last hour
